## Blockchain Technology

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and immutable record-keeping. It consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a set of transactions, linked together using cryptographic hashes.

### Key Concepts

#### Decentralization

![Decentralization](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5dfc18aeef0cf97edeb5ccd2/5fe10a2af06a8ab721095dc4_Physical%20Decentralization.png)

Decentralization means that no single entity controls the entire blockchain network. Instead, it operates on a peer-to-peer basis, with multiple nodes (computers) maintaining copies of the ledger. This decentralization enhances security and reduces the risk of a single point of failure.

#### Immutability

Immutability refers to the inability to alter or delete data once it has been added to the blockchain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain that makes it extremely difficult to tamper with historical records without consensus from the majority of the network.

#### Consensus Mechanisms

Consensus mechanisms are protocols that ensure all nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. Examples include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).

#### Smart Contracts

![Smart Contracts](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:611/1*hxc8uM7h0hRJB_6QiLzS6Q.png)

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute and enforce themselves when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

#### How Ethereum Blockchain Works

![Ethereum](https://logowik.com/content/uploads/images/ethereum3649.jpg)

- **Public database**: Records digital transactions permanently without a central authority.
- **Trustless system**: Individuals can make peer-to-peer transactions without needing to trust a third party.
- **Blockchain**: Cryptographically secure chain of blocks containing transaction data.
- **State machine**: Transitions to new states based on transactions.
- **Blocks**: Groups of transactions chained together.
- **Mining**: Validating transactions and adding new blocks to the chain.
- **Proof of work**: Miners compete to solve a complex math problem to validate a block.
- **Ether**: Ethereum's cryptocurrency, awarded to miners who validate blocks.
- **Single chain**: Only one chain of blocks is considered valid (GHOST protocol).
- **GHOST protocol**: Chooses the longest chain (most work done) as the valid one.
